# Steps in buying / selling house

The interaction between facilitator and players during buying and selling a house is quite complicated, also because part of the game takes place on the game board, and players should not be allowed to enter certain information in the app before the 'manual' process has been completed. Another complication is that buying houses can only take place when all players have decided on selling or staying (and negotiated prices if they sell a house to each other). Finally, calculating taxes has to wait till all players have moved into their new house, since the taxes are dependent on the number of players who live in a community.

The steps for buying a house in round 1 (and after selling their houses in later rounds) are as follows:

#### 1. Player state: `READ_NEWS`, facilitator state: `ANNOUNCE_NEWS`
- Player is on `read-news` screen. VIEW HOUSES button is grey.
- Facilitator's SHOW HOUSES button is not clicked yet.

#### 2. Player state: `READ_NEWS`, facilitator state: `SHOW_HOUSES_BUY`
- Facilitator clicks SHOW HOUSES button.
- Player is on read-news screen. VIEW HOUSES button is blue.
